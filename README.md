# BoneFractureDetection

In this project we developed an application using Flutter (an open-source UI software development kit created by Google) and Flask (Web Application Framework). The application takes the input from user and classifies it using ML (Machine Learning) model which is built using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm. The model will compute and classify whether the injury lies in the fracture section or not.
